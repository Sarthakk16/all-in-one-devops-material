1. What is Docker, and why is it used?
Answer:
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications in lightweight, isolated environments known as containers. Containers are portable and contain everything the application needs to run, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker enables developers to:
* Run applications consistently across different environments (development, testing, production).
* Ensure isolation, as containers are independent of the host environment.
* Deploy applications efficiently, utilizing less overhead than virtual machines (VMs).
* Support microservices architecture, where each service can run in its own container, isolated but can communicate with others.

2. What are the key components of Docker architecture?
Answer:
The core components of Docker architecture are:
* Docker Client: The user interface (CLI or API) for interacting with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker daemon.
* Docker Daemon (dockerd): The background service that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests.
* Docker Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. They include everything needed for an application to run (OS libraries, application code).
* Docker Containers: Running instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments in which applications run.
* Docker Registry: A repository where Docker images are stored and shared. Docker Hub is the default public registry.
* Docker Volumes: Persistent storage for containers that need to retain data beyond the container’s lifecycle.

3. Explain the difference between a container and a virtual machine.
Answer:
* Virtual Machine (VM): A VM emulates an entire physical machine with its own operating system (OS), which requires more system resources. VMs run on a hypervisor that manages multiple VMs on a host machine.
o Pros: Full isolation, complete OS environment.
o Cons: High overhead (resource consumption), slower startup times.
* Docker Container: Containers are lightweight and share the host OS’s kernel but isolate the application’s environment using cgroups and namespaces. They are much faster and consume fewer resources.
o Pros: Fast to start, lower overhead, portable.
o Cons: Shared OS kernel, less isolation than VMs.

4. What is a Docker image, and how is it related to a container?
Answer:
A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains the application and its dependencies, such as libraries, configurations, and environment variables. A container is a running instance of an image.
* Images can be thought of as blueprints, while containers are instances of those blueprints in action.
For example, you might have a python:3.9 image, and when you run it, you get a container running Python 3.9.

5. How do you pull an image from Docker Hub?
Answer:
To pull an image from Docker Hub, use the docker pull command followed by the image name:
bash
Copy code
docker pull <image-name>:<tag>
For example, to pull the latest version of the ubuntu image:
bash
Copy code
docker pull ubuntu:latest
If the image is not specified with a tag, Docker defaults to latest.

6. What are the different states a Docker container can be in?
Answer:
Docker containers can be in the following states:
* Created: The container is created, but not yet started.
* Running: The container is actively running.
* Paused: The container is paused, meaning its processes are temporarily stopped but the container remains in memory.
* Stopped: The container has stopped running but can be restarted.
* Exited: The container has finished execution and is no longer running.
* Dead: The container is in an abnormal state where it cannot be started again.
You can check the state of containers using docker ps (for running) and docker ps -a (for all containers).

7. How do you delete an image, container, or volume in Docker?
Answer:
To delete Docker resources:
* Remove a container:
bash
Copy code
docker rm <container-id>
* Remove an image:
bash
Copy code
docker rmi <image-id>
* Remove a volume:
bash
Copy code
docker volume rm <volume-name>
To remove all unused resources (images, containers, volumes):
bash
Copy code
docker system prune

8. What is the difference between docker run, docker start, and docker exec?
Answer:
* docker run: Creates a new container from an image and starts it. It’s typically used when you want to run a container for the first time.
bash
Copy code
docker run <image-name>
* docker start: Starts an existing container that has been previously stopped.
bash
Copy code
docker start <container-id>
* docker exec: Executes a command inside a running container. It is often used to access the container's shell or run one-off commands.
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash

9. Explain the purpose of docker ps and docker ps -a.
Answer:
* docker ps: Lists all currently running containers.
bash
Copy code
docker ps
* docker ps -a: Lists all containers, including those that are stopped.
bash
Copy code
docker ps -a

10. How is a Docker container different from a process running on the host machine?
Answer:
A Docker container is a lightweight, isolated environment running a process (or set of processes), but it shares the host OS kernel. The key differences are:
* Isolation: Containers are isolated from the host and other containers. Processes running on the host are part of the host OS and are not isolated.
* Environment: Containers include their own file system, libraries, and dependencies, making them portable across systems. Host processes rely on the host's OS for dependencies.
* Resource Management: Containers can be resource-limited using cgroups (memory, CPU), while host processes do not have this level of isolation by default.

11. What is a Dockerfile? How is it used?
Answer:
A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, dependencies, configurations, and the commands that need to be executed when the container starts.
* Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
To build an image from the Dockerfile, run:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t <image-name> .

12. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT define the command that should be run when the container starts, but they are used in different ways:
* CMD: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. It can be overridden when running the container.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
* ENTRYPOINT: Defines the command that will always be executed when the container starts. The parameters passed to docker run are appended to the ENTRYPOINT command.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
* Combination: You can use both. ENTRYPOINT defines the executable, and CMD provides default arguments.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]

13. What are the purposes of EXPOSE, WORKDIR, and ENV in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
* EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime. It doesn't publish the port; it’s mainly for documentation. Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
EXPOSE 80
* WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any subsequent commands. If the directory doesn’t exist, Docker creates it. Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
WORKDIR /app
* ENV: Sets environment variables in the container. These variables can be used by applications or scripts running inside the container. Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENV APP_ENV production

14. How do you add files to a Docker image during its build process?
Answer:
You can add files to a Docker image using the COPY or ADD instruction in the Dockerfile.
* COPY: Copies files or directories from the host to the container. Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
COPY ./src /app/src
* ADD: Similar to COPY, but also supports remote URLs and automatic extraction of compressed files. Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ADD https://example.com/package.tar.gz /app/package

15. What are the best practices for writing Dockerfiles?
Answer:
Here are some best practices for writing Dockerfiles:
* Use a small base image: Choose minimal images like alpine to keep the image size small.
* Leverage multi-stage builds: For optimized images, separate the build and runtime environments.
* Minimize layers: Reduce the number of layers by grouping commands (e.g., combine RUN statements).
* Order instructions wisely: Place frequently changing commands (e.g., COPY) towards the end to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.
* Use .dockerignore: Prevent unnecessary files (e.g., .git, node_modules) from being added to the image.
* Keep the image minimal: Remove build dependencies after use.

16. How do you specify dependencies in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
Dependencies can be specified in a Dockerfile using the RUN command to install packages, typically through the system package manager (apt-get, yum, etc.), or using a package manager for specific programming languages (e.g., pip, npm).
* Example (Python dependencies via requirements.txt):
Dockerfile
Copy code
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
* Example (System packages via apt-get):
Dockerfile
Copy code
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

17. What is a multi-stage build, and why is it used?
Answer:
A multi-stage build allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a Dockerfile, each creating a separate image stage. This helps to optimize the image size by separating the build environment from the runtime environment. The final image only contains the artifacts needed to run the application.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM golang:1.16 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Stage 2: Create a minimal image with just the compiled binary
FROM debian:bullseye-slim
COPY --from=build /app/myapp /usr/local/bin/myapp
CMD ["myapp"]

18. How do you cache layers in Docker to speed up builds?
Answer:
Docker caches layers by default when building an image. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer, and Docker will reuse these layers if they haven’t changed. To optimize caching:
* Order Dockerfile instructions so that the most static parts (e.g., RUN commands installing system dependencies) are at the top.
* Use .dockerignore to avoid copying unnecessary files and triggering unnecessary invalidations.
* Minimize changes: If an image layer changes, Docker will rebuild that layer and all subsequent layers.

19. What happens if no base image is specified in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
If no base image is specified, Docker will use the default image FROM scratch. This creates an empty container with no OS or tools, and you must manually add everything needed for the application to run, such as the OS, libraries, and the application code. This is typically used for minimalistic images (e.g., when creating an image from a compiled binary).

20. How can you debug issues in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
You can debug issues in a Dockerfile by:
* Using docker build --no-cache to avoid layer caching and ensure everything is rebuilt from scratch.
* Using docker build --progress=plain to get more verbose output during the build process.
* Running intermediate containers: Use the docker run -it command to inspect containers during the build process by adding RUN commands like RUN /bin/bash for debugging.
* Inspecting the image: After building an image, you can run it interactively with docker run -it <image-id> /bin/bash to check file locations, installed dependencies, etc.

21. How can you inspect a Docker image or container?
Answer:
You can use the following commands to inspect images and containers:
* Inspect an image:
bash
Copy code
docker image inspect <image-id>
This command shows detailed information about the image, including its layers, environment variables, and configuration.
* Inspect a container:
bash
Copy code
docker container inspect <container-id>
This command provides detailed information about a running or stopped container, including its mount points, network settings, and environment variables.

22. What is a Docker network?
Answer:
A Docker network is a virtual network that enables containers to communicate with each other, either on the same host or across different hosts in a Docker swarm. Docker supports different types of networks, such as:
* Bridge: The default network driver used for standalone containers. Containers connected to this network can communicate with each other.
* Host: Containers share the host network stack, which means no isolation for networking.
* Overlay: Used in Docker Swarm for multi-host networking.
* None: Containers have no network access.
You can create and manage networks using the docker network commands. Example to create a network:
bash
Copy code
docker network create my-network

23. What is Docker Compose?
Answer:
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you can define services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) and run them with a single command (docker-compose up).
Example docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: myapp
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=db
  db:
    image: postgres
To start the containers defined in the Compose file, use:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up

24. How do you scale services with Docker Compose?
Answer:
You can scale services in Docker Compose by using the --scale flag to specify how many instances (replicas) of a service you want to run.
For example, to scale the web service to 3 instances:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --scale web=3
Note: Scaling requires a Docker Swarm setup or a similar orchestrator to handle load balancing between containers.

25. How do you copy files from a host machine into a container and vice versa?
Answer:
* From Host to Container:
bash
Copy code
docker cp <file-path-on-host> <container-id>:<destination-path-in-container>
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker cp myfile.txt my_container:/app/
* From Container to Host:
bash
Copy code
docker cp <container-id>:<file-path-in-container> <destination-path-on-host>
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker cp my_container:/app/output.txt .

26. What is a Docker volume? How does it differ from a bind mount?
Answer:
* Docker Volume: A Docker volume is a storage mechanism that is managed by Docker and exists outside the lifecycle of containers. Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ by default). Volumes are recommended for persistent data storage.
Example of creating a volume:
bash
Copy code
docker volume create my-volume
* Bind Mount: A bind mount is a mapping of a specific file or directory from the host filesystem into a container. Bind mounts are more flexible but less portable because they depend on the host filesystem’s structure.
Example of a bind mount:
bash
Copy code
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-container

27. How do you create and manage Docker networks?
Answer: To create a Docker network, use the docker network create command:
bash
Copy code
docker network create <network-name>
To list existing networks:
bash
Copy code
docker network ls
To inspect a network:
bash
Copy code
docker network inspect <network-name>
To remove a network:
bash
Copy code
docker network rm <network-name>
You can also specify which network to attach a container to using the --network flag during container creation:
bash
Copy code
docker run --network <network-name> my-container

28. What are Docker Swarm and its features?
Answer:
Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool that enables the management of Docker containers at scale. It turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine, called a Swarm, which is useful for deploying multi-container applications across multiple machines.
Key Features:
* High Availability: Swarm manages container scheduling and ensures that containers are running on healthy nodes.
* Load Balancing: Swarm automatically distributes traffic across containers.
* Scaling: Services can be scaled up or down easily using the docker service scale command.
* Rolling Updates: Swarm supports rolling updates and rollbacks to ensure that updates are applied with minimal downtime.
To initialize a Swarm:
bash
Copy code
docker swarm init

29. How do you monitor Docker containers?
Answer: Docker provides several ways to monitor containers:
* docker stats: Provides real-time statistics for running containers, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
bash
Copy code
docker stats
* Docker API: You can use Docker's REST API to retrieve detailed information about containers, images, and the Docker host.
* Third-party tools: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and cAdvisor can be integrated with Docker to collect and visualize performance metrics.
* Docker logs: For debugging and monitoring container logs, you can use:
bash
Copy code
docker logs <container-id>

30. What is a Docker Hub?
Answer:
Docker Hub is the default public registry for Docker images. It allows you to share and distribute containerized applications. You can find official images for popular applications, libraries, and frameworks on Docker Hub.
* Key Features:
o Public and private repositories: You can store your own images either publicly or privately.
o Automated Builds: Docker Hub can automatically build images from a GitHub repository.
o Docker Trusted Registry (DTR): For enterprises, Docker Hub also offers a private, on-premises registry solution.
To pull an image from Docker Hub:
bash
Copy code
docker pull <image-name>
To push an image to Docker Hub:
bash
Copy code
docker push <username>/<image-name>

31. How do you persist data in Docker?
Answer:
Data persistence in Docker is achieved through volumes or bind mounts. Docker containers are ephemeral, meaning data inside a container will be lost when it stops or is removed. However, you can persist data using these methods:
* Volumes: Managed by Docker, they are stored in Docker’s default volume directory (/var/lib/docker/volumes/) or can be created with the docker volume create command. Volumes are preferred for data persistence because they are independent of container lifecycle and can be shared across containers.
Example to create and use a volume:
bash
Copy code
docker volume create my-volume
docker run -v my-volume:/app/data my-container
* Bind Mounts: Bind mounts map specific host directories to containers. They are useful when you need to persist data on the host filesystem.
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker run -v /host/data:/container/data my-container

32. What are Docker tags and how do you use them?
Answer:
Docker tags are used to version and identify different versions of Docker images. The tag is a label attached to the image name after a colon (:), for example, my-image:latest. Tags help differentiate between various versions of the same image.
* Common tag: latest is the default tag when you don’t specify one. Example:
bash
Copy code
docker pull nginx:latest
* Custom tags: You can specify custom tags for versioning:
bash
Copy code
docker tag my-image my-image:v1.0
Tags help in version control and can be used to pull specific versions of an image.

33. What is the difference between Docker and a virtual machine (VM)?
Answer:
The main differences between Docker containers and virtual machines are:
* Architecture:
o Docker: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and faster to start. Each container is isolated but does not have its own OS.
o VM: Each virtual machine runs its own OS on top of a hypervisor, making it heavier and slower to boot.
* Resource Efficiency:
o Docker: Containers are more efficient because they share the host system’s resources.
o VM: VMs require more resources because they run a full operating system with its own kernel.
* Start-up Time:
o Docker: Containers start instantly.
o VM: VMs take longer to start because they boot up an entire OS.

34. How can you manage container logs in Docker?
Answer:
You can manage and view container logs in Docker in the following ways:
* docker logs: This command is used to view logs from a specific container. Example:
bash
Copy code
docker logs <container-id>
* Log drivers: Docker supports different log drivers for containers (e.g., json-file, syslog, fluentd). You can specify the log driver in the docker run command:
bash
Copy code
docker run --log-driver=syslog my-container
* Log rotation: For managing log file sizes and rotating logs, you can configure log options such as max-size and max-file when running a container:
bash
Copy code
docker run --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 my-container

35. How do you expose a port in a Docker container?
Answer:
You expose ports in Docker containers using the -p or --publish flag in the docker run command. This maps a port on the host machine to a port on the container.
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:80 my-container
This maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container.
You can expose multiple ports by using additional -p flags:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 443:443 my-container
To list exposed ports for a container:
bash
Copy code
docker port <container-id>

36. How do you run a container in the background?
Answer:
To run a container in the background (detached mode), use the -d flag with the docker run command:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d my-container
This starts the container in the background and returns the container ID.
You can view the running containers with:
bash
Copy code
docker ps

37. What is the purpose of docker exec command?
Answer:
The docker exec command is used to execute commands inside a running container. It is useful for debugging or performing tasks inside a container without stopping it.
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
This opens an interactive terminal (-it flag) inside the container to run commands like bash, sh, or others.

38. How do you remove a Docker container?
Answer:
To remove a stopped container, use the docker rm command:
bash
Copy code
docker rm <container-id>
To remove all stopped containers at once:
bash
Copy code
docker container prune
To remove a container while it’s running (force removal):
bash
Copy code
docker rm -f <container-id>

39. How do you remove a Docker image?
Answer:
To remove a Docker image, use the docker rmi command:
bash
Copy code
docker rmi <image-id>
To remove all unused images (dangling images):
bash
Copy code
docker image prune
To remove images that are not associated with any containers:
bash
Copy code
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

40. What is a Docker registry, and how does it work?
Answer:
A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. It allows users to store and retrieve images, making it easy to share and deploy containerized applications.
* Docker Hub: The default public registry that Docker uses.
* Private Registry: You can also set up your own private Docker registry to store sensitive or internal images.
To push an image to a registry:
bash
Copy code
docker push <registry>/<username>/<image-name>:<tag>
To pull an image from a registry:
bash
Copy code
docker pull <registry>/<username>/<image-name>:<tag>
41. What is the Dockerfile, and how does it work?
Answer:
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It automates the process of creating images by specifying the base image, copying files, installing dependencies, setting environment variables, and defining the entry point for the container.
Basic structure of a Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official base image
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files from the host to the container
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Set environment variables
ENV APP_ENV=production

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the default command to run
CMD ["./start.sh"]
To build an image from the Dockerfile:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-image .

42. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
Answer:
* CMD: The CMD instruction sets the default command to run when the container starts. It can be overridden by providing a command at runtime.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
* ENTRYPOINT: The ENTRYPOINT instruction sets the command that always runs when the container starts. It cannot be overridden by passing a command at runtime (unless using --entrypoint).
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
If both ENTRYPOINT and CMD are used, CMD will provide default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT.

43. How do you manage container lifecycle in Docker?
Answer:
Container lifecycle management in Docker involves creating, starting, stopping, restarting, and removing containers. Some common commands for managing container lifecycle:
* Create a container:
bash
Copy code
docker run <image-name>
* Start a stopped container:
bash
Copy code
docker start <container-id>
* Stop a running container:
bash
Copy code
docker stop <container-id>
* Restart a container:
bash
Copy code
docker restart <container-id>
* Pause and Unpause a container:
bash
Copy code
docker pause <container-id>
docker unpause <container-id>
* Remove a container (stopped):
bash
Copy code
docker rm <container-id>

44. What is the docker swarm command?
Answer:
docker swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool that allows you to manage a multi-container, multi-host environment (Docker Swarm mode). It turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine. Some common commands for Docker Swarm are:
* Initialize a Swarm:
bash
Copy code
docker swarm init
* Add worker nodes to a Swarm:
bash
Copy code
docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:<port>
* List Swarm nodes:
bash
Copy code
docker node ls
* Create a service in a Swarm:
bash
Copy code
docker service create --name my-service -p 80:80 nginx
* Scale a service:
bash
Copy code
docker service scale my-service=5

45. What is the Docker build cache?
Answer:
The build cache in Docker is used to speed up the image build process. When you build a Docker image, Docker caches the results of each instruction in the Dockerfile (such as copying files, installing packages, etc.). If Docker detects that an instruction has not changed (e.g., source files haven’t changed), it will use the cache from the previous build rather than re-executing the instruction.
You can disable the build cache using the --no-cache option:
bash
Copy code
docker build --no-cache -t my-image .

46. How do you troubleshoot a Docker container?
Answer:
When troubleshooting a Docker container, use the following approaches:
1. Logs: Use the docker logs command to check container logs.
bash
Copy code
docker logs <container-id>
2. Interactive shell: Use docker exec to enter a running container and check its state.
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
3. Container status: Check if the container is running or has stopped.
bash
Copy code
docker ps
docker ps -a
4. Inspect the container: Use docker inspect to get detailed information about the container’s configuration.
bash
Copy code
docker inspect <container-id>
5. Network issues: Use docker network ls and docker network inspect to debug network-related problems.

47. What is the role of a docker-compose.yml file?
Answer:
The docker-compose.yml file defines and manages multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to specify multiple services (containers), networks, volumes, and other settings for your application in a single configuration file. With docker-compose, you can start, stop, and manage all containers in an application with a single command (docker-compose up).
Example docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: myapp
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=db
  db:
    image: postgres
To start the services:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up

48. How do you use environment variables in Docker?
Answer:
You can use environment variables in Docker in the following ways:
* In a Dockerfile: Set environment variables using the ENV instruction:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENV APP_ENV=production
* At runtime: Set environment variables with the -e flag during container creation:
bash
Copy code
docker run -e APP_ENV=production my-container
* From a .env file: Docker Compose can load environment variables from a .env file. Example of a .env file:
env
Copy code
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
In docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - DB_USER
      - DB_PASS

49. What is the use of docker stats command?
Answer:
The docker stats command provides real-time performance metrics for running containers, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network activity. This is useful for monitoring the resource usage of containers during runtime.
Example:
bash
Copy code
docker stats <container-id>
If you want to monitor all containers, use:
bash
Copy code
docker stats

50. What is Docker’s default network mode?
Answer:
The default network mode in Docker is bridge. When you run a container without specifying a network, Docker automatically attaches the container to a virtual bridge network on the host. This bridge network allows containers to communicate with each other and the host, while providing some isolation.
To run a container with the bridge network:
bash
Copy code
docker run --network bridge my-container
51. What is Docker’s networking model?
Answer:
Docker provides several distrole of networking modes for containers, which are:
1. Bridge Network (default):
o The default network mode for containers. Containers on a bridge network can communicate with each other, but they are isolated from other networks and the host machine.
o Communication between containers on the same host is possible, but accessing the container from outside the host requires port mapping (-p).
2. Host Network:
o The container shares the host’s networking namespace, which means it has direct access to the host's network interfaces.
o This mode offers improved performance but removes the isolation between the container and host.
3. Overlay Network:
o Used for multi-host communication, typically in Docker Swarm. It allows containers on different hosts to communicate securely across the network.
4. None:
o Containers in this mode are completely isolated from all networks. They do not have any network interfaces.
5. Container Network:
o This allows one container to share the network namespace of another container, making them share the same network settings (IP, ports).

52. What is Docker Compose, and how does it work?
Answer:
Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure application services, networks, and volumes. With Compose, you can define multiple services (containers) in a single file and manage them collectively.
To use Docker Compose:
1. Define your services in a docker-compose.yml file.
2. Use docker-compose up to start all the services.
3. Use docker-compose down to stop and remove all services.
Example of a docker-compose.yml file:
yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: myapp
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=db

53. What is Docker's multi-stage build?
Answer:
Multi-stage builds allow you to optimize Docker images by reducing their size and complexity. It enables you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile, where each FROM creates a new image layer. The idea is to use one stage for building the application (e.g., compiling code) and then copy the results to a lighter, final image (e.g., a minimal base image like alpine).
Example of a multi-stage build:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Build stage
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Final stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

54. How do you handle secrets in Docker?
Answer:
Docker does not directly provide a built-in feature for managing secrets, but you can use several approaches:
* Environment Variables: Pass secrets via environment variables using the -e flag in docker run:
bash
Copy code
docker run -e MY_SECRET=mysecretvalue my-container
* Docker Secrets (Swarm Mode): Docker Swarm includes a secrets management feature for securely storing and distributing sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys. You can store secrets using docker secret create and reference them in your services within a docker-compose.yml file.
Example of creating and using a secret in Swarm:
bash
Copy code
docker secret create my_secret /path/to/secret/file
In docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy code
version: '3.7'
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    secrets:
      - my_secret
secrets:
  my_secret:
    external: true

55. What is a Docker image registry?
Answer:
A Docker image registry is a storage location for Docker images. It is where you can store, share, and distribute images. The most popular registry is Docker Hub, but you can also use private registries (e.g., AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).
Common Docker registry operations:
* Pull an image from the registry:
bash
Copy code
docker pull nginx
* Push an image to the registry:
bash
Copy code
docker push my-image:latest
* List available images on Docker Hub or another registry.

56. How do you configure Docker to work with a proxy?
Answer:
To configure Docker to work with a proxy, you need to set proxy environment variables in Docker's system configuration files. Docker needs to be aware of the HTTP and HTTPS proxy settings to make requests.
* Global Docker settings: You can configure proxy settings by editing the Docker daemon configuration file (/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf) or adding environment variables to /etc/default/docker.
Example of proxy configuration in /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf:
bash
Copy code
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy:8080"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy:8080"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,.mydomain.com"
* For individual containers: Use the -e flag with docker run to set environment variables for a container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -e HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy:8080 my-container

57. How do you monitor a Docker container's resource usage?
Answer:
Docker provides several ways to monitor container resource usage:
1. docker stats: Displays real-time stats about running containers, such as CPU, memory, network I/O, and block I/O.
bash
Copy code
docker stats <container-id>
2. docker top: Displays the processes running in a container.
bash
Copy code
docker top <container-id>
3. Third-party monitoring tools: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog can be used to monitor Docker containers at scale.

58. What is a Docker volume, and how does it differ from a bind mount?
Answer:
A Docker volume is a managed storage mechanism that is independent of the container’s filesystem. Volumes are created and managed by Docker, and data stored in volumes is persisted even if the container is deleted. Volumes are ideal for storing application data, databases, and logs.
A bind mount is a mapping of a host machine’s directory to a container. Unlike volumes, bind mounts are not managed by Docker and directly rely on the host filesystem.
* Volumes are stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ (default location).
* Bind mounts use the host’s filesystem.

59. What is Docker's docker ps command?
Answer:
The docker ps command lists all running containers on your system. It provides details such as the container ID, image name, status, and ports.
* To list all containers (running and stopped), use:
bash
Copy code
docker ps -a
* To list running containers with specific details:
bash
Copy code
docker ps --filter "status=running"

60. How do you scale a service in Docker Swarm?
Answer:
In Docker Swarm, you can scale a service by specifying the number of replicas (containers) you want to run for that service.
To scale a service:
1. Create the service:
bash
Copy code
docker service create --name my-service --replicas 3 my-image
2. Scale the service:
bash
Copy code
docker service scale my-service=5
You can also specify the number of replicas in the docker-compose.yml file and use docker-compose up to apply the configuration.
61. What is the docker exec command, and how is it used?
Answer:
The docker exec command is used to run commands inside a running Docker container. It allows you to interact with a container, open a shell, and run processes or commands as though you are inside the container.
Common usage:
* Run a shell inside a container:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
* Run a command in a container:
bash
Copy code
docker exec <container-id> <command>
For example, to check the processes running inside a container:
bash
Copy code
docker exec <container-id> ps aux
The -it flags stand for interactive (-i) and terminal (-t), allowing you to interact with the container.

62. How do you update or upgrade a Docker container?
Answer:
To update or upgrade a Docker container, you generally have to follow these steps:
1. Stop and remove the current container:
bash
Copy code
docker stop <container-id>
docker rm <container-id>
2. Pull the latest image:
bash
Copy code
docker pull <image-name>:latest
3. Recreate the container using the updated image:
bash
Copy code
docker run <options> <image-name>:latest
If using Docker Compose, you can update the services by running:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

63. How do you persist data in Docker containers?
Answer:
Data persistence in Docker containers is typically handled through volumes and bind mounts:
* Volumes: Volumes are managed by Docker and are used to persist data outside of the container’s filesystem. This ensures data is not lost when the container is removed. Example:
bash
Copy code
docker run -v my-volume:/data my-container
* Bind mounts: Bind mounts map a host directory to a container directory. Changes to the files in the host directory are reflected inside the container. Example:
bash
Copy code
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-container

64. What is the purpose of Docker’s docker inspect command?
Answer:
The docker inspect command provides detailed information about a Docker object, such as a container, image, volume, or network. It returns a JSON output containing metadata about the object, including configuration, network settings, mounts, environment variables, and more.
To inspect a container:
bash
Copy code
docker inspect <container-id>
For an image:
bash
Copy code
docker inspect <image-id>
You can filter the output using --format:
bash
Copy code
docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Env}}' <container-id>
This helps in debugging and understanding the configuration of containers and images.

65. What is Docker's docker prune command, and what does it do?
Answer:
The docker prune command is used to clean up unused Docker objects, such as containers, volumes, networks, and images. It helps free up disk space by removing objects that are no longer in use.
There are several types of docker prune commands:
* Remove unused containers:
bash
Copy code
docker container prune
* Remove unused images:
bash
Copy code
docker image prune
* Remove unused volumes:
bash
Copy code
docker volume prune
* Remove unused networks:
bash
Copy code
docker network prune
* Remove all unused objects:
bash
Copy code
docker system prune
The docker system prune command removes all unused containers, networks, images, and optionally volumes. You can also use the -a flag to remove all unused images, not just dangling ones:
bash
Copy code
docker system prune -a
